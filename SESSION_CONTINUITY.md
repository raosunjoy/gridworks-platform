## 🚨 Critical Rules

### **NEVER**
- ❌ Break existing tests without fixing them
- ❌ Reduce test coverage below 100%
- ❌ Exceed performance thresholds
- ❌ Compromise security standards
- ❌ Start new work without reading this guide

### **ALWAYS**
- ✅ Read PROJECT_STATUS.md before starting
- ✅ Run tests before and after changes
- ✅ Update status tracker with progress
- ✅ Commit with detailed messages
- ✅ Maintain performance benchmarks

## 📊 Quick Status Check Commands

```bash
# Project health check (run first)
git status
git log --oneline -3
python -m pytest tests/ --tb=short -q

# Performance check
# (Would run performance benchmarks)

# Coverage check
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Security check
# (Would run security scans)
```
