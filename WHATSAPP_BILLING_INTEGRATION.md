# WhatsApp + Stripe + Setu API Billing Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Overview: WhatsApp-Native Billing Experience**

### **The Challenge**
- **WhatsApp Limitation**: Cannot process payments directly within WhatsApp
- **User Experience**: Users want seamless billing without leaving WhatsApp
- **Multi-Tier Complexity**: Different tiers need different billing approaches
- **Indian Market**: UPI preference + regulatory compliance

### **The Solution: Hybrid Integration**
**WhatsApp (UX) + Setu API (Collection) + Stripe (Management) = Seamless Experience**

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Setu API Integration for UPI Collection**

```python
class SetuBillingClient:
    async def create_upi_collection(self, user_id: str, amount: int, description: str):
        """Create UPI collection request"""
        
        response = await self.post("/collections/requests", {
            "amount": amount,
            "purpose": "OTHERS",
            "generateURI": True,
            "expiryTime": 15,  # 15 minutes
            "customer": {
                "id": user_id,
                "phone": user_phone
            },
            "settlementAccount": {
                "id": "trademate_settlement"
            }
        })
        
        return {
            "collection_id": response["id"],
            "upi_uri": response["upiURI"],
            "payment_url": response["shortURL"]
        }
    
    async def setup_auto_debit(self, user_id: str, account_id: str):
        """Setup auto-debit for per-trade fees"""
        
        response = await self.post("/account-aggregator/consent", {
            "customer": {"id": user_id},
            "purpose": "AUTOMATED_PAYMENTS",
            "fiTypes": ["DEPOSIT"],
            "consent": {
                "start": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "expiry": (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=365)).isoformat(),
                "frequency": "DAILY",
                "maxAmount": 50000  # ₹500 max per transaction
            }
        })
        
        return response["consentId"]
```

### **2. WhatsApp Interactive Billing Messages**

```python
async def send_subscription_billing_request(phone: str, tier: SupportTier, amount: int):
    """Send tier-specific billing request via WhatsApp"""
    
    # Tier-specific messaging
    messages = {
        SupportTier.PRO: {
            "text": f"🚀 **GridWorks PRO Subscription**\n\n₹{amount/100:,.0f}/month includes:\n⚡ Professional tools\n🤖 Advanced AI\n🎤 Voice trading\n📊 Priority support\n\n*Choose payment method:*",
            "buttons": [
                {"id": "pay_upi", "title": "💳 Pay with UPI"},
                {"id": "pay_card", "title": "💸 Pay with Card"},
                {"id": "billing_help", "title": "❓ Need Help?"}
            ]
        },
        SupportTier.BLACK: {
            "text": f"◆ **GridWorks BLACK Membership**\n\n₹{amount/100:,.0f}/month includes:\n🎩 24/7 concierge\n🤖 Dedicated butler\n🚁 Emergency response\n🏛️ Luxury partners\n\n*Your butler will assist with payment*",
            "buttons": [
                {"id": "butler_payment", "title": "🎩 Butler Assistance"},
                {"id": "direct_payment", "title": "💳 Direct Payment"},
                {"id": "concierge_call", "title": "📞 Concierge Call"}
            ]
        }
    }
    
    await whatsapp_client.send_interactive_message(
        phone=phone,
        **messages[tier]
    )
```

### **3. Per-Trade Fee Automation**

```python
async def collect_trade_fee(user_id: str, trade_amount: float, symbol: str):
    """Collect per-trade fee automatically"""
    
    # Get user tier and calculate fee
    user_tier = await get_user_tier(user_id)
    fee_amount = calculate_trade_fee(user_tier, trade_amount)
    
    if fee_amount > 0:
        # For LITE/PRO: Auto-debit via Setu
        if user_tier in [SupportTier.LITE, SupportTier.PRO]:
            collection = await setu_client.collect_instant_payment(
                user_id=user_id,
                amount=fee_amount,
                description=f"Trading fee: {symbol}"
            )
            
            # Notify via WhatsApp
            await whatsapp_client.send_message(
                phone=user_phone,
                message=f"✅ {symbol} trade complete!\n💳 Fee: ₹{fee_amount/100} auto-charged\n📊 Balance updated"
            )
        
        # For ELITE/BLACK: Accumulate for monthly billing
        else:
            await accumulate_monthly_fee(user_id, fee_amount, f"Trade: {symbol}")
    
    return {"fee_collected": fee_amount, "method": "auto_debit"}
```
